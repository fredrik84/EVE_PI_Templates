# EVE_PI_Templates
Put PlanetaryInteractionTemplates folder in <users>\Documents\EVE

Put out miners, install extractor heads, create route between extractor and storage box
Put out factories, put material in any launchpad and it will automatically fetch what it needs from one of them

Numbers for filling 30k of materials into factories

This setup produces 0.5 P4 per planet per hour.

Mathing is 10 factories producing either Wetwares or Self-Harm Cores will produce 12 per day.
10*12 equals 120 P4 per day. At current price when writing that is 2 million ISK per P4.
This setup should be worth about 240 mil per day with 10 factories, which equals about 7.2b per month.
